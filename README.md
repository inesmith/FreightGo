## About the Project

### Project Description

FreightGo is a logistics management platform developed to streamline freight service booking and tracking. The platform connects users who need freight services with transporters, simplifying the logistics process and providing an efficient and transparent way to manage freight operations.

The project includes essential features such as:

- **User and Transporter Registration**: Users and transporters can register to access specific functionalities, like booking and accepting freight services.
- **Freight Booking and Tracking**: Users can select freight type, destination, and schedule, while transporters can accept and track these orders.
- **User and Transporter Dashboards**: Different dashboards for users and transporters to view bookings, manage schedules, and track deliveries.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible on various devices for a seamless user experience.

The project is built using the MERN stack, with MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.

### Built With

- **MongoDB**: For database management and storage.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for handling routes and API calls.
- **React**: Frontend framework for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for backend services.
